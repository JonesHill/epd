        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <strong>Why should my child see a pediatric dentist instead of our regular family dentist?</strong><br>
          <p>Pediatric dentistry is a dental specialty that focuses on the oral health of young people. Following dental school, a pediatric dentist has two to three years additional specialty training in the unique needs of infants, children and adolescents, including those with special health needs.</p>

        <strong>At what age should my child have his/her first dental visit?</strong><br>
          <p>First visit by first birthday is the general rule. To prevent dental problems, your child should see a pediatric dentist when the first tooth appears, usually between 6 and 12 months of age, certainly no later than his/her second birthday.</p>

        <strong>When do the first teeth start to erupt?</strong><br>
          <p>At about 6 months, the two lower front teeth (central incisors) will erupt, followed shortly by the two upper central incisors. The remainder of the baby teeth appear during the next 18 to 24 months but not necessarily in an orderly sequence from front to back. At 2 to 3 years, all of these 20 primary teeth should be present.  See the page on Tooth Eruption fo more information.</p>

        <strong>How can I help my child through the teething stage?</strong><br>
          <p>Sore gums when teeth erupt are part of the normal eruption process. The discomfort is eased for some children by use of a teething biscuit, a piece of toast or a frozen teething ring. Your pharmacy should also have medications that can be rubbed on the gums to reduce the discomfort.</p>

        <strong>When should my child start using toothpaste?</strong><br>
          <p>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends you clean your child's teeth with water and a soft-bristled toothbrush up to age 1.   After 1 year of age, parents may use a small smear of fluoridated toothpaste on a soft bristled toothbrush to clean their child's teeth. A pea-sized amount of toothpaste may be used after your child learns to spit out the excess toothpaste.  Parents should always supervise brushing to ensure children do not swallow any toothpaste.</p>

        <strong>What causes tooth decay?</strong><br>
          <p>Four things are necessary for cavities to form -- a tooth, bacteria, sugars or other carbohydrates and time. Dental plaque is a thin, sticky, colorless deposit of bacteria that constantly forms on everyone's teeth. When you eat, the sugars in your food cause the bacteria in plaque to produce acids that attack the tooth enamel. With time and repeated acid attacks, the enamel breaks down and a cavity forms.</p>

        <strong>What is baby bottle tooth decay and how can I prevent it?</strong>
          <p>Baby bottle tooth decay is a pattern of rapid decay associated with prolonged nursing. It happens when a child goes to sleep while breast-feeding and/or bottle-feeding. During sleep, the flow of saliva is reduced and the natural self-cleansing action of the mouth is diminished. Avoid nursing children to sleep or putting anything other than water in their bedtime bottle. Encourage your child to drink from a cup as they approach their first birthday. He/she should be weaned from the bottle at 12-14 months of age.</p>

        <strong>If my child gets a cavity in a baby tooth, should it still be filled?</strong><br>
          <p>Primary, or "baby," teeth are important for many reasons. Not only do they help children speak clearly and chew naturally, they also aid in forming a path that permanent teeth can follow when they are ready to erupt. Some of them are necessary until a child is 12 years old or longer. Pain, infection of the gums and jaws, impairment of general health and premature loss of teeth are just a few of the problems that can happen when baby teeth are neglected. Also, because tooth decay is really an infection and will spread, decay on baby teeth can cause decay on permanent teeth. Proper care of baby teeth is instrumental in enhancing the health of your child.</p>

        <strong>If my child gets a toothache, what should I do?</strong><br>
          <p>To comfort your child, rinse his/her mouth with warm salt water and apply a cold compress or ice wrapped in a cloth on your child's face if it is swollen.  Do not put heat or aspirin on the sore area, but you may give your child acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen for pain.  Contact our office as soon as possible to schedule an appointment.</p>

        <strong>What happens to my child's teeth if they use a pacifier or suck their thumb?</strong><br>
          <p>Thumb and pacifier sucking habits that go on for a long period of time can create crowded, crooked teeth or bite problems. If they are still sucking their thumbs or fingers when the permanent teeth arrive, a mouth appliance may be recommended by your pediatric dentist. Most children stop these habits on their own.</p>

        <strong>How safe are dental X-rays?</strong><br>
          <p>With contemporary safeguards, such as lead aprons and high-speed film, the amount of radiation received in a dental X-ray examination is extremely small. Even though there is very little risk, pediatric dentists are particularly careful to minimize the exposure of child patients to radiation. In fact, dental X-rays represent a far smaller risk than an undetected and untreated dental problem.</p>

        <strong>I noticed a space between my child's two upper front teeth. Is this cause for concern?</strong><br>
          <p>Usually, the space between your child’s two front teeth is caused by the little piece of tissue that connects the upper lip to the gum between the two front teeth.  This piece of tissue is called a maxillary frenum.  More often than not, the space will close in the next few years as the other teeth erupt and usually no immediate treatment is indicated.  Our office can determine whether there is cause for concern.</p>

        <strong>My child plays sports. How should I protect my child's teeth?</strong><br>
          <p>A mouth guard should be a top priority on your child's list of sports equipment. Athletic mouth protectors, or mouth guards, are made of soft plastic and fit comfortably to the shape of the upper teeth.
They protect a child's teeth, lips, cheeks and gums from sports-related injuries. Any mouth guard works better than no mouth guard, but a custom-fitted mouth guard fitted by our doctor is your child's best protection against sports-related injuries.</p>
